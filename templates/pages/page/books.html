    <p>
      I hated reading for most of my life. I started reading in 2017 after a friend gave me the book
      Chaos Monkeys as a gift for mentoring his university students.

      To my surprise, I now love reading. Iâ€™m always looking for new books so, if you have any
      suggestions, please let me know!
