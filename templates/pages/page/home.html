      I'm an independent software developer from Canada. Web development is my primary focus,
      but I also like to dabble with mobile apps, games, and design.

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>
      I love building things. Here are some of the projects I currently maintain.
    </p>

    {% for project in projects %}
      {% if not project.Retired %}
        {% include '../../partials/project.html' with project=project %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}

    <h2>Retired Projects</h2>

    <p>
      Some projects don't stand the test of time. Here are a few that I've had to shut down for
      various reasons.
    </p>

    {% for project in projects %}
      {% if project.Retired %}
        {% include '../../partials/project.html' with project=project %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}

    <h2>My Favorite Things</h2>

    <ul>
      {% for thing in favoriteThings %}
        <li>
          <a href="{{ thing.Link }}">
            {{ thing.Name }}
          </a> â€“ {{ thing.Description }}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
