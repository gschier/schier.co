I got fed up with WordPress so I developed my own simple blogging platform using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "Node.js"), [Express](https://expressjs.com/ "Express Web Application Framework"), and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown") as a post format.

This blog will be home to various topics (mostly development related) that come up in my life, along with a few tutorials and other things.


Enjoy.
