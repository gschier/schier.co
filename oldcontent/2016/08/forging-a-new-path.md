Just over a month ago, I left my job to pursue a career as an independent software developer. In
other words, I quit my job to work on an app by myself. I am now officially "living the dream" _(ugh)_.

The decision to leave was not sudden. I wrestled with it for months. My job was great, it paid well, 
and the team was awesome. I just couldn't stop thinking about the things I was doing outside of 
work. I wanted to leave, but the thought of making such a big change was fraught with fear and 
uncertainty. "Maybe next month", I would say.

Six months went by without change. I felt the same. 

Then, rather suddenly, I woke up one morning and my mind was made. I gave my resignation that day.

It's been over a month since I left, and I'm happy to say that I made the right decision. The 
thing that I'm working on now is [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), a two-year-old side
project of mine, and I'm super excited to be able to take it to the next level.

I'll be writing updates like this every week or two, so feel free to follow along. It should be 
good.
