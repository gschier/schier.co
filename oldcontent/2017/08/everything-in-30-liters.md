_I'm currently sitting in the Vancouver International Airport, in my sweatpants, writing 
this post; waiting to board a plane to London, one-way, with no plans of returning any 
time soon._

This blog has been very quiet for the past year. The 
[last major post](/blog/2016/08/05/forging-a-new-path/) was about my shift
from a start-up employee to an independent app developer, which has gone extremely well.
So well, in fact, that it now generates enough income to sustain my lifestyle indefinitely.
Achievement unlocked! 🏅

**Now, it's time for the next big thing**: Travel 🚀

My partner Jess and I have spent the last month selling, donating, and recycling
all our stuff in order to go on a long-term adventure. All we have left
are two backpacks full of our most essential possessions. 

We are officially homeless.

We've only planned the start of our journey – booking 1-month stays in Nice France, 
Lisbon Portugal, and Split Croatia – but are hoping to continue as long as possible.
