Instead of making resolutions at the beginning of each year, I like to decide on a focus instead. Last year's focus was getting back on track with nutrition and exercise in order to fix my chronic back pain. This year, I've decided to focus on being more creative. But why creativity?

## Why Creativity?
Ever since quitting my _real job_ three years ago, I've been working independently on growing my software startup [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest). The journey has been really great but it's also been a lot of work, leaving little time for other hobbies. As a result, I've spent the last six months weaving in and out of burnout and generally feeling lost and unfocused. I need something to get excited about again.

My early childhood was full of creative hobbies. I sketched and drew ideas, played guitar, and rode BMX. These things all fell by the wayside, however, when I moved away from home to attend University. So, it's time to bring some of those things back into my life.

## Creativity on the iPad Pro
Two weeks ago I bought an iPad Pro with the pencil and keyboard case. In fact, I'm using it to write this very post! Anyway, the iPad has already done a great job helping with creativity. Mostly, I think, because that's what it does best. It's just so enjoyable to use! 

I started drawing a lot in an app called [Procreate](https://procreate.art) and really love it. So far, I've found drawing digitally to be much more forgiving than physical paper, helping me learn to be more okay with making mistakes (mostly thanks to undo/redo), resulting in higher-quality work which helps provide motivation to create things more often. 

Aside from drawing, I've also been writing a lot more using [Bear](https://bear.app). I started journalling every day and have also been drafting a few articles to post on this blog. I think I'll start with those two activities for now and see where they take me.

## Starting New Projects
Even though it's only mid-January, being more creative has already had a big impact on my well-being. It's exciting to have things to look forward to again and I've found that I've been able to replace some of my bad habits with enjoyment. Win-win! But I think something is still missing.

One of my favorite things about making software is sharing what I'm working on. So far, I've been sharing some of the art I've produced but it's just not the same since art isn't as interactive as an app or website, making it less likely to spawn feedback or discussion from my peers. So, apart from drawing just for the sake of it, I've been trying to come up with some larger projects that I could try. Here are a few things I'm toying with:

- Medium length videos of me drawing something, Bob Ross style
- Solo podcast, although I haven't come up with a topic
- Start blogging again (if you're reading this I've succeeded!)
- Get into photography

I've already started on recording some drawing videos and have also began dabbling with photography and photo editing as well. The hard part will be keeping with it though.

## Looking Forward
I'm excited to continue with my creative pursuit and can't wait to see how it impacts my life. One of the cool things about this is that there isn't really an end; it's the journey that's exciting, along with the small wins that come with practice and improvement.

So keep an eye out the rest of this year and hopefully you'll see some exciting stuff from me ðŸ˜Š ðŸŽ‰
