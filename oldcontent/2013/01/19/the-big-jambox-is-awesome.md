I heard about the Jawbone [BIG JAMBOX](https://jawbone.com/speakers/bigjambox/overview) a couple of weeks ago and decided to order one on a whim. I've spent the last few days with it and am very impressed so far. It sounds great, it's portable, and the battery lasts a *long* time. The $300 price tag was worth every penny.
