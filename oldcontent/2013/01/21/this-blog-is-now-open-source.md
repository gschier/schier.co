This blogging platform was built because I was sick of WordPress. I wanted something fast, simple, and easily extendible. The goal from the start was to create something that anyone could use but I didn't want to make the code available until it had a strong feature set. As of right now, the main features of the platform consist of the following:

- Create a new post
- Preview a post before submission
- Leave a comment
- Posts tagging for organization #cool
- Include code snippets in posts and comments (uses [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/))
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax for posts

This was my first experience creating a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module for [NPM](https://npmjs.org) and it went smoother than expected. Now that I know how easy the process is hopefully I'll be posting more modules in the future.

Oh! I almost forgot. The module is called *simple-blog* and can be found on Github at [/gschier/simple-blog](https://github.com/gschier/simple-blog)
