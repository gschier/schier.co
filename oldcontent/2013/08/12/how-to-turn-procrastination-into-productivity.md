Some of my most productive and creative periods are the few days leading up to a big deadline at school. Those who know me well are aware that I am not a fan of the education system. I currently attend the University of Victoria for Software Engineering and am seven courses short of graduation. This post will detail one trick that I've learned that uses procrastination of course deadlines to enhance productivity in other areas. 

Today is August 11, 2013 and my three final exams are on the 13th, 14th, and 15th (2 days away). Since I'm a huge procrastinator when it comes to school, I haven't even begun to study yet. I have, however, been getting a lot done on other projects, getting exercise, and even doing chores. My subconscious seems to think that if I'm putting off something as important as studying then I had better replace it with something more important.

So it seems that I have finally done it! I have found a way to turn procrastination into productivity.

Anyway, I should stop writing now and go start studying...

Eventually...
