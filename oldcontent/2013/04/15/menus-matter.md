At [ForkJoy](https://www.forkjoy.com) we believe that the best way to spread the word about excellent food is through high quality menus.

The best menus highlight the offerings of a restaurant by combining a generous helping of vivid photographs with a dash of enticing descriptions which is then topped with a dollop of thoughtful comments.

Our focus has not only been on building an extensive database of complete restaurant menus for a growing number of cities but also on building a better way for restaurant owners/managers to efficiently create and manage their online presence including beautiful menus.

We have created a unique palate of elegant yet effective business solutions for restaurants including the 'Time-Sensitive Deals' platform and an awesome social media menu management tool called the [ForkJoy Menu Widget](https://www.forkjoy.com/foj).

We will expand on these valuable business solutions in future posts but if you are interested in exploring them right now please check out our restaurant management tools at [ForkJoy Manager](https://www.forkjoy.com/restaurantinfo).

As always please contact us at info@forkjoy.com with any questions or comments!
