Since I don't own a television, for various reasons, I get my entertainment from listening to podcasts. My subscription list has been steadily growing over the past couple years and my count is currently at 22. This seems to work out to about 2 podcasts per day, which in my opinion is borderline too many. I don't want to have to trim this list down at all, but I may have to in the future.

My podcatcher of choice right now is [PocketCasts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts). In my opinion this is one of the best apps on Android right now and I highly recommend checking it out.
