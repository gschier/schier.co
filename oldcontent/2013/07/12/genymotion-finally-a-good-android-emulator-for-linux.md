The emulator can be found at [genymotion.com](https://www.genymotion.com/).

I should preface this post by stating that I have only used the Genymotion emulator for around twenty minutes, but it has already impressed me to the point where I would consider using as my main app testing device (I currently use a hardware device).

I have a few problems with the official Android emulator:

- Hard to enable x86 emulation on Linux
- Difficult to spoof GPS coordinates
- Not very user friendly

In the short period of testing Genymotion, all of these points were resolved. Installation was literally less than five minutes, the emulator ran buttery smooth, and there were lots of configuration options for testing and running apps. It even comes with images that include the official Google apps so you can essentially use the emulator like a regular hardware device. 

Anyway, I highly recommend that you give this project a chance if you do any sort of Android development. Also, thanks to [WebUpd8](https://www.webupd8.org/2013/07/genymotion-fast-easy-to-use-android-x86.html) for posting about this.

**NOTE:** *Genymotion 2.0 is here. I wrote a [mini tutorial](/post/install-genymotion-2.0-in-ubuntu) on how to install it in Ubuntu*
