*tl;dr* -- Just check out [the tutorial](https://maketecheasier.com/install-ubuntu-12-10-in-macbook-air/2012/11/08).

I just want to take a second to thank Damien over at [Make Tech Easier](https://maketecheasier.com/) for providing some awesome instructions on how to get Ubuntu running on a Macbook Air. I recently followed his guide for [Ubuntu 12.10](https://maketecheasier.com/install-ubuntu-12-10-in-macbook-air/2012/11/08) but have also used his [Ubuntu 12.04](https://maketecheasier.com/install-dual-boot-ubuntu-in-macbook-air/2012/08/27) guide as well. Surprisingly, Ubuntu runs better on my Air than it ever did on my previous Dell or Asus laptops. Even the screen brightness controls work! I highly recommend a Macbook Air to any Ubuntu enthusiast looking for something new.
