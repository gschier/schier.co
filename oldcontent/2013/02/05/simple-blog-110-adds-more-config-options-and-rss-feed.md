RSS has been something I've been wanting to add to *Simple Blog* for a while now and finally implemented it. It was easy to set up using the [node-rss](https://github.com/dylang/node-rss) module and the whole update only took one or two hours to complete. You can check out the [pull request](https://github.com/gschier/simple-blog/commit/25925bb2ee5d3fc06d8427040244f3fcf5b415f2) if you're curious. Along with RSS, I also added a few more config options which are detailed in the example code of the README.

Oh, and if you want to subscribe to this blog, the RSS link is in the footer. If you're too lazy to scroll it's also [right here](https://admin.schier.co/rss.xml).
