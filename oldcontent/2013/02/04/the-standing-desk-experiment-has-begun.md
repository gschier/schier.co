A few days ago I decided to put a few cardboard boxes on my desk I could stand up and work. There has been a lot of talk on the internet recently about the benefits of standing desks and it's fairly obvious that not sitting down for twelve hours a day is good for you. Anyway, here is my setup.

The first day or two I got sore after a couple hours, but today I felt great all day. I find myself walking around a lot when trying to solve problems, and I seem to have a lot more energy in the evenings. I did have to give up my multi-monitor setup but it's my personal opinion that the multi-monitor productivity boost is a myth, at least in my workflow anyway.
