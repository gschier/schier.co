I just spent about half an hour moving the keys around on my Macbook Air to mirror the [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) keyboard layout. I've been typing in Colemak for about a year and a half now and thought it was time to violate my Air. I scraped the nubs off the "F" and "J" keys and added temporary nubs (some reflective tape) to the "T" and "N" keys until I have time to go buy some glue and do it properly.
