I needed a break from filling out a [SR&ED](https://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/txcrdt/sred-rsde/menu-eng.html) application today so I decided to write some code. At first I wanted to see if I could make a CSS-only block splicing app but realized that it was more difficult than I thought. I decided to continue on with a bit of JQuery assistance and here is the result. It works by placing 4 equal sized divs into any div you click/hover on. Have fun!

<pre class="codepen" data-height="460" data-type="result" data-href="iGCKu" data-user="gschier" data-safe="true"><code></code><a href="https://codepen.io/gschier/pen/iGCKu">Check out this Pen!</a></pre>
<script async src="https://codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

*P.S.* As you can see I'm using [Codepen](https://codepen.io) for this demo. This is my first time using it but it has already impressed me. I don't normally spend time writing little meaningless demos but I want to start making it a regular occurrence so stay tuned for more in the future. They will be under the [#demo](https://schier.co/tag/demo) tag.
