Discovering [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) yesterday has motivated me try more programming *experiments*. I've been wanting to build a pong clone for a while so I decided to finally give it a try. Unfortunately it is too much code to write inside of CodePen's interface (my opinion), but I was able to write a Pong simulation in just over 100 lines. Here it is:

<pre class="codepen" data-height="340" data-type="result" data-href="zxFGs" data-user="gschier" data-safe="true"><code></code><a href="https://codepen.io/gschier/pen/zxFGs">Check out this Pen!</a></pre>
<script async src="https://codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

I started a [Github repository](https://github.com/gschier/simple-pong) for the project that I plan on eventually finishing, but for now I'll leave it at this.
