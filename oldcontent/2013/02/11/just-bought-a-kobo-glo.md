I've been curious about e-readers for a while now and finally decided to pick one up. Apparently Adobe Digital Editions works under Wine on Linux so I should be able to export all of my existing Google Books purchases. Don't disappoint me Kobo!

*Edit*: I got up and running with no problems by following a great tutorial by [Robert Penz](https://robert.penz.name/440/howto-install-adobe-digital-editions-on-ubuntu-12-04-and-use-it-with-an-e-book-reader/).
