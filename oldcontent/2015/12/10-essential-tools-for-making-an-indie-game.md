When I started working on my first game [Platform Pixels](https://platformpixels.com)
about a year ago, I had no idea how much work it would be. Since starting the project I
have learnt how to make a game, create music, design graphics, edit video, and
a bunch of other useful stuff!

As I prepare for the initial launch, I though it would be cool to put together a
list of the tools I found most useful throughout the development process. This
list contains 10 essential tools but I also through in some not-so-essential
mentions at the bottom.


### 1. libGDX – Game Framework

[libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) is a cross-platform game framework
that uses Java as a base language. Essentially, you write an Android game in
Java and libGDX transpiles it so that it runs on iOS, HTML5, Desktop, and even
Blackberry. This is the reason that I can have Android, iOS, and Desktop
versions in beta at the same time (and I'm only one person!).


### 2. IntelliJ – Code Editor

[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is by far my favourite code editor.
It is fast, lightweight, powerful, and has even prevented bugs from creeping in.

### 3. Affinity Designer – Graphic Design

[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) is actually one
of the reasons I switched Linux to Mac OSX. It is a great vector/bitmap program
that makes it really easy to design app icons, promotional materials, and more.
I even use it as a level editor.

### 4. Garage Band – Music Creator

[Garage Band](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) is an Apple product that
helps me pretend that I know how to make music. I get the impression that it's
fairly basic if you are an audio guru, but for a newb like me it's awesome! All
the music you'll hear in the game is created by me in Garage Band.

### 5. Microwave Express – Basic Audio Editor

[Microwave Express](https://microwaveformac.com/) is a very basic audio editing
tool that I used to trim sound effects and balance audio levels.

### 6. Screenflick – Screen Recorder

[Screenflick](https://www.araelium.com/screenflick) is a screen recording tool
that can do it all. It can record retina resolution screencasts and has support
for awesome stuff like highlighting the mouse cursor, showing keystrokes, and
overlaying a webcam feed on top of the recording. It can also export to almost
any format you can name, including animated gif!

### 7. iConvert Icons – App Icon Generator

[iConvert Icons](https://iconverticons.com/) is a simple tool that generates
app icons for multiple platforms from a single image. Platforms like iOS and
Android require icons to be in 5-10 different sizes, so this can save a lot of
time.

### 8. iMovie – Movie Creator

[iMovie](https://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/) is yet another Apple product that I
used. I haven't produced anything public-facing with it yet, but I've started
working on a simple game trailer which it seems to do fairly well at.

### 9. GameAnalytics – Free Analytics Tool

[GameAnalytics](https://www.gameanalytics.com/) is similar to Google Analytics
except better for games. It can be easily integrated with multiple platforms and
best of all, it's free!

### 10. Buffer – Social Media Management

[Buffer](https://buffer.com) is a tool to help you be better at social media. I have
been using it to post to both Google+ and Twitter throughout the day.

## Honorable Mentions

The tool above were the necessary for building Platform Pixels, but there are
a few more that I want to mention that have helped along the way.

- [Surge](https://surge.sh) – Static website publishing
- [Trello](https://trello.com) – Task management and organization
- [99designs](https://99designs.ca/) – Graphic Design Service
- [Keka](https://www.kekaosx.com/) – File archiving/unarchiving
- [packr](https://github.com/libgdx/packr) – Package JARs as desktop apps
- [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) – Mac terminal replacement
- [Capitalize My Title](https://capitalizemytitle.com/) – Title capitalizer
- Pen and Paper – For note taking


## Wrap Up

The tools I have mentioned above are the tools that I currently prefer. Almost
all of them have competitive alternatives that would also work, but these are
the ones I prefer.

What tools do you use to build games? I'd be curious to see if some of my
recommendations have better alternatives. If you have any suggestions feel free
to reach out. If not, thanks for reading!
