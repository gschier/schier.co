Platform Pixels is a mobile-first 2D platformer meant to be simple, easy to
learn, yet extremely difficult. If this is your first time hearing about it,
check out the brand new [Website](https://platformpixels.com) (WEEOOO!) to find
out more.

Enough introduction, let's get into what's new in Beta 2!


Release Details
---------------

Beta 2 removes all hand-made levels. Good riddance! Those things too me hours to 
make! The levels in this update are now generated programmatically by a beta
level generator I've been working on.

At this point, the generator produces fairly basic levels, but I am already
impressed with it considering the minimal amount of effort I've put into it
so far. Look forward to more unique and interesting levels the generator
progresses. Here's a sample screenshot of what it looks like when I run the
generator from the command line.

*NOTE: Since the level generator is a constant work in progress, every new
beta release will likely have completely different levels, so don't get too
attached to your game play progress.*

Other than the level generator, not much is new. I've been spending a lot of
time on non-game stuff like the [New Website](https://platformpixels.com),
design of the level generator, a logo, and written content like this. My reason
for this focus is to start attracting attention and users to help drive the
game's development. So, if you made it this far and you like what you see, it
would be a big help if you shared this with your friends and coworkers.


Up Next
-------

The level generator will be a big focus for me over the next few releases. Since
the website and logo are almost done, I'll have a bit more time to spend on the
actual game. Here are a few things that I'll be focusing on in the next few
updates:

- better level generation
    - more feature variation
    - more manageable difficulty progression
- new block types
    - disappearing blocks
    - flashing blocks
- transition screens
    - tutorial screen (showing what the controls are)
    - loading screen between levels
    - splash screen on game start with logo
- persistent game state
    - save what level you're on
- leaderboards

Let me know what you think of the generated levels so far. Thanks for reading!
