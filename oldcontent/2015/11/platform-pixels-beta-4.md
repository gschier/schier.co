I didn't have enough time to push out a beta last week, so I've put some extra
effort in this week to make up for it. Check out the gif below for a teaser of
Beta 4 gameplay!

Up Next
-------

In the next beta, I'm going to be spending a lot of time on new levels, so look
forward to that. The current beta has one world with only three levels. In the
next beta, I want to add more levels to that world as well as start on a second
world a different theme.

Other than level creation, I want to start playing with new game mechanics. My
goal is to introduce a new mechanic with every world to help keep things
interesting. Here are a some ideas I've came up with so far.

*Ideas for new mechanics*:

- moving obstacles (enemies?)
- slippery walls
- slow motion
- gravity inversion
- springs
- conveyor belts

I've also been passively thinking of ways to add visual flair. I want to give
each world a unique parallax background and potentially some moving scenery like
weather or flickering lights. This might not make it into the next beta but you
never know...

Keeping with the visual improvements, I also created some mockups for a *real*
UI. Here's a very early sample of what I'm thinking.

That's it for this week's beta. As always, let me know what you think and have
fun playing!
