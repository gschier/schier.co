So I was browsing through my Google Analytics data today and noticed something interesting; less than one percent of visitors used the tag feature ‒ so I got rid of it.

I've decided to keep the feature around and use it for my own personal organization, but it will not be shown to the readers. Hooray for a cleaner interface!
