No longer excited or optimistic about blogging. I grew tired. It saddened me to think of the time that had passed since I published something to be proud of. I wanted to get back into it. I needed to. But I couldn't.

I decided to do something fun instead. There had been a lot of fuss in the web development community about static site generators, which gave me an idea. Maybe if I write my own static site generator I'll be excited enough about it to want to write again. So I did.

I called it Balloon. Why? Because balloons generate static. DUH! The source code is on [Github](https://github.com/gschier/balloon) if you want to see, but to be honest, you shouldn't use it. It works for me, but it's not ready. I'll probably rewrite it later, but it works for me right now and that's all that matters.
