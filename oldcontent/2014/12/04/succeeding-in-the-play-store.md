One of my favourite things to do is start new side projects. Three years ago, my roommate
[Adrian](https://twitter.com/acorscadden) and I decided to build a mobile app to keep track of
the books we wanted to read. So we put together some designs and started building.

We came up with the name *To Read*. The plan was to build functional apps for iOS and Android
and submit both before the weekend ended. At the expense of a bit of sleep, we made our deadline.
Adrian built the [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/to-read-reading-list/id562795303)
and I wrote and [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gregschier.toread).

Three years has passed since then and I've learned a lot. This wasn't the first Android app I'd built
but it was the first to be geared towards the global market. The other apps I'd made had
either been local-specific or small one-off experiments with no real attempt to grow a user base.


I wanted to get a lot of users on To Read so I spent a lot of time trying
different things to see if they worked. I'm going to talk about a few of the main things I tried, but
there are quite a few that won't make it in to this post. If you're curious, I'm always up for
chatting. You can find my contact info somewhere on this page. Anyway, here's what I did.


## 1. Description and Screenshots

This is key. Every app is required to have a description and screenshots, and for good reason.
I don't actually have any data on how well this works since it was the first thing
I did, but I do know how much I appreciate quality screenshots when looking for new apps to try.

Don't hesitate on this one, just do it. Also be sure to upload screenshots for all device sizes
you support because, depending on what device is viewing the Play Store, different screenshots will
be shown to based on the characteristics of the device.


## 2. Social Media

I don't have much to say here. I put up a Google Plus page but never really had enough time to
engage with community and build an audience. This is the something I would like to do if I had the
time to spend on it.


## 3. Advertising

After the first month of waiting, To Read wasn't gaining any traction. I was determined to get
users, but I didn't have much spare time to spend on doing something creative – so I tried throwing
money at it. I put up some adds on [AdMob](https://www.google.com/ads/admob/?_adc=) and my bank
account balance started going down.

AdMob didn't bring in a lot of users. About fifty per day at most. I couldn't even really notice
a bump from advertising in the active users graph. It also turned out that the users that came in
through advertising were not very active. I had implemented some behavior tracking using
[Flurry](https://www.flurry.com/), which turned out to be super useful for monitoring user activity.
It helped me and noticed that the users that came from ads basically didn't even use the app. So,
after spending about $200, I moved on.


## 3. Waiting

One of the strang things I noticed after submitting To Read to Google Play was how long it took
before it started appearing in search results. I expected my wait time to be measure in days.
However, this was not the case. I kept waiting...

I expected To Read's invisibility in search to have an impact on install numbers. I wasn't doing
any marketing so the only way to get users organically was through Google Play search. The worst
part about it was that I had no control.

I kept waiting, and eventually gave up. A few months later I took another shot at advertising,
spending another few hundred dollars. Nothing.

All development on To Read had stopped for almost a year. I checked the stats once in a while
but nothing really changed. Last November, however, brought a bit of surprise. Numbers suddenly
started going up.


They kept going up. Exponentially. What the fuck!? Two weeks later and they were still increasing.
I had to find out why. I forget how I came across it, but I searched for *reading list* on Google
Play and found To Read at the top.

It's still there today. I was happy. Below shows the install graph for To Read. The graph
was much more impressive at the time. When looking at the graph around February 2014 it created
the ideal hockey stick shape that everyone dreams of.

I still don't know how or why it happened, but I'm very curious. Why did it take so long to become
searchable? Does it always take that long? Were the key words too generic? I'll never know.


## Closing Thoughts

The main thing I learned from this experience was that the mobile app world mostly luck. Sure,
there are things you can do to increase your odds, but in the end it all comes down to luck.

You probably noticed installs have started to trail off lately. Again, I have no idea why. Nothing
has changed that I've noticed. I plan on doing a few more updates but as I said before, I'm pretty
busy. Maybe I'll get lucky again and have another growth spurt.

Thanks for reading.
