Two months ago I was co-founder of a startup with three of my closest friends. Having spent the two previous years pouring sweat and tears into a product without seeing results, we were spent. I wasn't happy. It was time for a change.

I spent two weeks in self-reflection, trying to figure things out. Going for walks, sleeping too much, staying up late. Depression was leering. Then, an opportunity arose.

I was invited to spend four months living and working in San Francisco with a team I had previously contracted for. The opportunity of a lifetime. The outcome was unknown and accepting would mean giving up everything I had worked for over the past two years. A fresh start. Exactly what I needed.

The decision was easy; saying yes to such an opportunity was a no-brainer. Saying goodbye to my team, however, would be horrible. And it was.
