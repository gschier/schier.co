There would be six of them. Six fucking roommates. I couldn't imagine what it would be like. I was worried. Would I have to share a bedroom? How would I cope without privacy? How would people react to experiencing the *real* me? My excitement of moving to California was slowly being replaced with stress and doubt.

It's been two weeks so far and I can't believe how well it's going. I can't believe that I don't hate everyone yet. In fact, I like everyone. And I also can't believe that I haven't been craving time to myself.

There's still a lot of time for things to change, but right now I'm living in a dream.
